            <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are Affected In Floods</h1>
            <p>From 11 May 2022, heavy rains and mountain slopes continue. Due to this flood started in Sylhet. The
                Surma, Sari, the Luva, the Dhalai, Kushiyara flows through the interior of the district, and the water
                flows through the danger zone at each point. As the upstream water continues to recede, the lowlands are
                inundated anew.</p> <br>

            <p>Doctors Worldwide is currently working to provide a floating medical boat in a number of key areas
                starting with Beanibazar and Boroleka Upazila after which we will expand into the other Upazilas. The
                medical boat will travel to shelters and marooned families to treat sick patients who currently do not
                have access to medical care.</p>
